# React-geolocation-app
Small app, more like a practice for obtaining geolocation from user and display a message based on his geographic latitude position, according to season type: summer or winter.

Used both class and functional components, componentDidMount lifecycle method, state and props.
For the display used some help from semantic-ui. Enjoy!
